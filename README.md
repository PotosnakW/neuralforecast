## Preprocess Data
Preprocessing scripts are located in the `./data_preprocessing` folder. Preprocessed `simglucose` data from the open-source `simglucose` repository [1] is included in the `./data` folder.


## Train Models

To train the models, follow these steps:

1. Install the open-source Neuralforecast repository [2]. The repository is included here for convenience.

```bash
pip install -e .
```



2. Navigate to the `./train_models` folder and run the training script:

```bash
cd ./train_models
python run_training_scripts.py
```

## Evaluate Models
To evaluate the models, open and run the `./evaluate_model.ipynb` notebook.
